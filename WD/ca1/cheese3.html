                        Mozzarella
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    Bit of a boring first choice, however, it's many's favorite for a reason. This baby on a pizza rocks. 
                    Unfortunately, pizza is a regular in my diet and pizza without Mozzarella is not a pizza - change my mind.
                    You can appreciate fresh mozzarella with a sprinkle of olive oil, coarse salt, and pepper, since it has a marginally acidic or lactic taste, however not pungent. 
                    You can make a straightforward Caprese serving of mixed greens or eat it with tomatoes in a sandwich.

                    <p>
                    Considered to be among the top cheeses by cheese connoisseurs, for me however, it comes in at number 2. 
                    It's usually grated over pasta or soups, it can <em>also</em> be eaten as a snack.

                        Cheddar
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    Cheddar cheese is dry and crumbly in texture, with a deep, tangy, nutty flavor. The color varies from ivory to straw to deep yellow. 
                    Cheddar is used to top burgers, as well as in other types of sandwiches. 
                    This one's a classic, timeless.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    Gouda is a semi-hard to hard cow's milk cheese from the Netherlands. 
                    At the point when Gouda is matured the cheese changes its flavor and surface. 
                    Matured Gouda has a solid flavor, with a sharp yet sweet taste simultaneously.
                    Melted young gouda is delicious.

                    <p>
                    Cow's milk, sheep's milk or goat's milk + a very distinctive smell.
                    Lil' spicy, maybe lil' creamy, but it adds <em>soooooo</em> much class to a simple meal.
