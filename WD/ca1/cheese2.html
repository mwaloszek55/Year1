                    It's pretty simple – a nine pound round of <b>Double Gloucester</b> cheese is moved from the <em>highest</em> point of the slope and contenders pursue it down to the base. 
                    The principal individual over the end goal is delegated victor, with the <i>cheese</i> as their prize. Initially, the point was to get the cheese, nonetheless, with its one-second head start and how rapidly it picks up speed, 
                    this turns out to be really <strong>troublesome</strong> – and perilous! Before, onlookers have been harmed by the moving cheese, and in 2013 the cheese was supplanted with a foam copy for safety reasons.
