                    Early Cheeses
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, one of the earliest technologies humanity has obtained was the art of cheese making.
                    It is believed that cheese was first found around 8000 BC around when sheep were first tamed.
                    They delighted in a wide assortment of cheeses, and cheese making was at that point considered a work of art. They gave hard cheese to the Roman armies.
                    In fact, the word "Cheese" comes from the latin word <i>"caseus"</i> the foundation of which is followed back to the proto-Indo-European root kwat, which means to age or ferment.

                    European Cheeses
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What's more, when the Western Roman Empire imploded, 
                    cheesemaking kept on advancing in the estates that spotted the middle age European open country.
                    In the several Benedictine religious communities dispersed across Europe, middle age priests tested perpetually with various kinds of milk, 
                    cheesemaking practices, and maturing measures that prompted a considerable lot of the present famous cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster and a few Swiss sorts were completely refined and consummated by these cheesemaking pastors.
                    In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was especially effective â€“ delivering a bunch of bovine's milk cheeses. Before the finish of the fourteenth century, 
                    Alpine Cheese from the Gruyere locale of Switzerland had become so beneficial that a neighboring state attacked the Gruyere good countries to assume responsibility for the developing cheddar exchange.

                    Evolution of Cheese
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Cheese stayed mainstream through the Renaissance, 
                    and the Industrial Revolution removed creation from the religious community and into machinery. 
                    Today, the world creates approximately 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, delivered and devoured far and wide. 
                    Yet, 10,000 years after its creation, nearby homesteads are as yet continuing in the strides of their Neolithic progenitors, 
                    hand making one of humankind's most established and most loved nourishments.
