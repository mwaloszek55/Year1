            <p>
                A rainbow is sunlight spread out into its spectrum of colors and diverted to 
                the eye of the observer by water droplets. The <b>bow</b> part of the word 
                refers to the fact that the rainbow is a <em>group</em> of nearly 
                <b>circular</b> arcs of color all having a common center.

                The main ingredients to see a rainbow are the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to be standing with the sun to your <b>back</b> and the rain in front of you.</li>
                <li>The sun needs to be less than <b>42&deg;</b> above the horizon.</li>
                <li>The sun's rays must be hitting the <b>raindrops</b> to create the rainbow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="question">Why do people believe there's a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow?</h1>
            <p>
                Even as far back as the 17th century, people knew that we cannot see the 
                complete circle of the rainbow. People in the 17th century became fond of
                saying that one was as likely to find a pot of gold as to find the end of the
                rainbow. The expression somehow changed, and became a part of mythology.
